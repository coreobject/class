## Process

**Design your object**
+ Physical form
+ Interaction
+ Circuit

**Create you Bill of Materials**
A list of all of the parts you will need for the form and the circuit. Links to where they can be sourced and the datasheet.
You only need the parts for the circuit you are creating. The power supply and Arduino components are already accounted for.

**Aquire parts**
We will setup a class buy but you will need to be ready.

**Prototype the circuit on a solderless breadboard**

**User test**

**Layout your pcb using eagle/illustrator**

**Burn, drill, and solder your PCB**

**Create your enclosure**

**User test**
